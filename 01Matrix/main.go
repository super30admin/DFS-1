    connected components!
    A dist in a cell (that already reached 0) can tell us a dist for a cell that cannot reach 0 directly
    
    approach: BFS
    - We need starting INDEPENDANT nodes.
    - 0s do not depend on anything, we are not looking for distance of each 0 to another 0
    - So 0s are independant
    - Enqueue all 0 positions
    - While we are all looking for all 0's , we will mark all the 1's = -1
        - Why? Well this is to distinguish between 1 as a distance vs visited/not-visited.
    - So when we are processing all 0's from our queue
    - We will look for all -1's ( unvisited nodes around this 0 )
    - When we find it, we will enqueue all neighbouring -1's ( but change the value of them to currentNode val + 1)
    - Then we will have cells with 1's in our queue
    - Keep looking for all -1's around each item from our queue, keep adding current val + 1 to new all -1's we find.
    - Instead of keeping the distance maintained at each level, the cell being processed itself will tell us how far away this cell is from a 0.
    - We can take that info and add + 1 for its neighbors that are -1.
    - And then repeat until full matrix is processed
